We begin by making a cell with a rectangle in it:\n\n\nusing\n \nDevices\n,\n \nDevices\n.\nPreferMicrons\n,\n \nFileIO\n\n\n\ncr\n \n=\n \nCell\n(\nrect\n,\n \nnm\n)\n\n\nr\n \n=\n \ncentered\n(\nRectangle\n(\n20\n\u03bcm\n,\n \n40\n\u03bcm\n))\n\n\nrender!\n(\ncr\n,\n \nr\n,\n \nRectangles\n.\nPlain\n(),\n \nGDSMeta\n(\n1\n,\n0\n))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that when you use \nDevices.PreferMicrons\n, this will also enable the unqualified use of the following units: \npm\n, \nnm\n, \n\u03bcm\n, \nmm\n, \ncm\n, \ndm\n, \nm\n, \n\u00b0\n, \nrad\n. (By unqualified we mean that the symbols are imported into the calling namespace and do not need to be prefixed with a module name.) When adding length units together, if the units don't agree, the result will be in microns. You can \ninstead\n do \nusing\n \nDevices.PreferNanometers\n if you want the result to default to nanometers. (These are your two choices at the moment, though there's nothing fundamentally limiting other possibilities: see \nsrc/units.jl\n for how to do this for other units.)\n\n\nWhen you specify the units for a \nCell\n, you are specifying a database unit. Anything rendered into this cell will be discretized into integer multiples of the database unit. This means that nothing smaller than 1 nm can be represented accurately. Nonetheless, this is typically a satisfactory choice for superconducting devices.\n\n\nA rectangle made with a width and height parameter will default to having its lower-left corner at the origin. \ncentered\n will return a rectangle that is centered about the origin instead.\n\n\nThe rectangle is then rendered into the cell. \nRectangles.Plain()\n specifies a rendering style. Other examples include \nRectangles.Rounded\n (where the corners are rounded off) or \nRectangles.Undercut\n. You can omit the style, in which case \nRectangles.Plain()\n will be assumed. \nGDSMeta(1)\n indicates the target GDS-II layer. You can also specify the GDS-II datatype as a second argument, e.g. \nGDSMeta(1,0)\n.\n\n\nIn another cell, we make the transmission line with some launchers on both ends:\n\n\np\n \n=\n \nPath\n(\n\u03bcm\n)\n\n\nsty\n \n=\n \nlaunch!\n(\np\n)\n\n\nstraight!\n(\np\n,\n \n500\n\u03bcm\n,\n \nsty\n)\n\n\nturn!\n(\np\n,\n \n\u03c0\n/\n2\n,\n \n150\n\u03bcm\n)\n\n\nstraight!\n(\np\n,\n \n500\n\u03bcm\n)\n\n\nlaunch!\n(\np\n)\n\n\ncp\n \n=\n \nCell\n(\npathonly\n,\n \nnm\n)\n\n\nrender!\n(\ncp\n,\n \np\n,\n \nGDSMeta\n(\n0\n))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, let's put bridges across the feedline:\n\n\nturnidx\n \n=\n \nInt\n((\nlength\n(\np\n)\n+\n1\n)\n/\n2\n)\n \n-\n \n1\n \n# the first straight segment of the path\n\n\nsimplify!\n(\np\n,\n \nturnidx\n+\n(\n0\n:\n2\n))\n\n\nattach!\n(\np\n,\n \nCellReference\n(\ncr\n,\n \nPoint\n(\n0.0\n\u03bcm\n,\n \n0.0\n\u03bcm\n)),\n \n(\n40\n\u03bcm\n)\n:\n(\n40\n\u03bcm\n)\n:\n((\npathlength\n(\np\n[\nturnidx\n]))\n-\n40\n\u03bcm\n),\n \ni\n=\nturnidx\n)\n\n\nc\n \n=\n \nCell\n(\ndecoratedpath\n,\n \nnm\n)\n\n\nrender!\n(\nc\n,\n \np\n,\n \nGDSMeta\n(\n0\n))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow easy was that?\n\n\nYou can save a GDS file for e-beam lithography, or an SVG for vector graphics by using \nsave\n with an appropriate extension:\n\n\nsave\n(\n/path/to/myoutput.gds\n,\n \nc\n)\n\n\nsave\n(\n/path/to/myoutput.svg\n,\n \nc\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that SVG support is experimental at the moment, and is not completely optimized. It is however used in generating the graphics you see in this documentation. If you use Juno for Atom, rendered cells are automatically previewed in the plot pane provided you enter \nDevices.@junographics\n at the start of your session.

This means that a lot of time will be wasted repeating compilations if you run Devices.jl in a script like you would in other languages. For readability, it is best to split up your CAD code into functions that have clearly named inputs and perform a well-defined task. At present, for performance reasons, it is also best to avoid writing functions with keyword arguments (though this will be addressed in Julia 1.0).\n\n\nIt is also best to avoid writing statements in global scope. In other words, put most of your code in a function. Your CAD script should ideally look like the following:\n\n\nusing\n \nDevices\n,\n \nDevices\n.\nPreferMicrons\n,\n \nFileIO\n\n\nusing\n \nCoordinateTransformations\n\n\nusing\n \nClipper\n\n\n\nfunction\n \nsubroutine1\n()\n\n    \n# render some thing\n\n\nend\n\n\n\nfunction\n \nsubroutine2\n()\n\n    \n# render some other thing\n\n\nend\n\n\n\nfunction\n \nmain\n()\n\n    \n# my cad code goes here: do all of the things\n\n    \nsubroutine1\n()\n\n    \nsubroutine2\n()\n\n    \nsave\n(\n/path/to/out.gds\n,\n \n...\n)\n\n\nend\n\n\n\nmain\n()\n \n# execute main() at end of script.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can then \ninclude\n this file from Julia to generate your pattern. Provided you write your script this way, subsequent runs should be several times faster than the first if you \ninclude\n the file again from the same Julia session.\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\n\n\nIf you cannot save the GDS file, try deleting any file that happens to be at the target path. A corrupted file at the target path may prevent saving.\n\n\nDecorated styles should not become part of compound styles, for now. Avoid this by decorating / attaching cell references at the end.",

It also records the time of its own creation. As currently implemented it mirrors the notion of cells in GDS-II files.\n\n\nTo add elements, use \nrender!\n. To add references, push them to \nrefs\n field.\n\n\nsource\n\n\nThe type parameter \nS\n of a \nCell{S,T}\n object is used in two ways:\n\n\n\n\nDetermine the units of the coordinates of all polygons in a cell, as well as origins and offset vectors of \nCellArray\ns and \nCellReference\ns.\n\n\nDetermine whether the cell will contain integer coordinates or floating-point coordinates. Currently, you cannot do a whole lot (particularly with regard to paths) if the cell has integer coordinates. However, they do have an inherent advantage because the coordinates are exact, and ultimately the GDS-II file represents shapes with integer coordinates. In the future, we intend to improve support for cells with integer coordinates.\n\n\n\n\nFor instance, \nCell{typeof(1.0u\"nm\")}\n matches a cell where the database unit is \nnm\n and polygons may have \nFloat64\n-based coordinates (the type of \n1.0\n is \nFloat64\n). Note that \nCell{typeof(2.0u\"nm\")}\n does not mean the database unit is 2.0nm, because the returned type is the same. If that is intended, instead make a new unit such that one of that new unit is equal to 2nm. You can do this using the \n@unit\n macro in Unitful.\n\n\nFor most cases, if you want to use units, \nCell(\"my_cell_name\", nm)\n is a good way to construct a cell which will ultimately have all coordinates rounded to the nearest \nnm\n when exported into GDS-II. You can add polygons with whatever length units you want to such a cell, and the coordinates will be converted automatically to \nnm\n. You can change \nnm\n to \npm\n or \nfm\n or whatever, but this will limit the pattern extent and probably doesn't make sense anyway.\n\n\nIf you don't want units, just construct the cell with a name only: \nCell(\"my_cell_name\")\n will return a \nCell{Float64}\n object. In this case too, the ultimate database resolution is \n1nm\n; until exporting the cell into a GDS-II file, the coordinates are interpreted to be in units of \n1\u03bcm\n.

The nodes are linked to each other, so each node knows what the previous and next nodes are.\n\n\n\n\nSegments\n\n\nEach subtype of \nSegment\n can represent a class of parametric functions \nt-\nPoint(x(t),y(t))\n. By \"class\" we mean e.g. \nPaths.Straight\n or \nPaths.Turn\n, which are used frequently. Instances of these subtypes of \nSegment\n have some captured variables to specify a particular path in the plane. Instances of \nTurn\n, for example, will capture an initial and final angle, a radius, and an origin. All circular turns may be parameterized with these variables.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis package assumes that the parametric functions are implemented such that $\\sqrt{((dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2)} = 1$. In other words, \nt\n ranges from zero to the path length of the segment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStyles\n\n\nEach subtype of \nStyle\n describes how to render a segment. You can create the most common styles using the constructors \nPaths.Trace\n (a trace with some width) and \nPaths.CPW\n (a coplanar waveguide style).\n\n\nOne can implement new styles by writing methods for \nrender!\n that dispatch on different style types. In this way, the rendering code can be specialized for the task at hand, improving performance and shrinking generated file sizes (ideally).\n\n\n\n\nTapers\n\n\nAs a convenience, this package provides functions for the automatic tapering of both \nPaths.Trace\n and \nPaths.CPW\n via the \nPaths.Taper\n constructor. Alternatively, one can specify the tapers concretely by calling their respective constructors.\n\n\nThe following example illustrates the use of automatic tapering. First, we construct a taper with two different traces surrounding it:\n\n\nusing\n \nDevices\n,\n \nDevices\n.\nPreferMicrons\n\n\n\np\n \n=\n \nPath\n(\n\u03bcm\n)\n\n\nstraight!\n(\np\n,\n \n10\n\u03bcm\n,\n \nPaths\n.\nTrace\n(\n2.0\n\u03bcm\n))\n\n\nstraight!\n(\np\n,\n \n10\n\u03bcm\n,\n \nPaths\n.\nTaper\n())\n\n\nstraight!\n(\np\n,\n \n10\n\u03bcm\n,\n \nPaths\n.\nTrace\n(\n4.0\n\u03bcm\n))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe taper is automatically chosen to be a \nPaths.Trace\n, with appropriate initial (\n2.0 \u03bcm\n) and final (\n4.0 \u03bcm\n) widths. The next segment shows that we can even automatically taper between the current \nPaths.Trace\n and a hard-coded taper (of concrete type \nPaths.TaperTrace\n), matching to the dimensions at the beginning of the latter taper.\n\n\n```@example 2\nstraight!(p, 10\u03bcm, Paths.Taper())\nstraight!(p, 10\u03bcm, Paths.Trace(2.0\u03bcm, 1.0\u03bcm))\n\n\nAs a final example, `Paths.Taper` can also be used in [`turn!`](paths.md#Devices.Paths.turn!) segments, and as a way to automatically transition from a `Paths.Taper` to a `Paths.CPW`, or vice-versa:\n\n\n```@example 2\nturn!(p, -\u03c0/2, 10\u03bcm, Paths.Taper())\nstraight!(p, 10\u03bcm, Paths.Trace(2.0\u03bcm))\nstraight!(p, 10\u03bcm, Paths.Taper())\nstraight!(p, 10\u03bcm, Paths.CPW(2.0\u03bcm, 1.0\u03bcm))\n\nc = Cell(\ntapers\n, nm)\nrender!(c, p, GDSMeta(0))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorners\n\n\nSharp turns in a path can be accomplished with \nPaths.corner!\n. Sharp turns pose a challenge to the path abstraction in that they have zero length, and when rendered effectively take up some length of the neighboring segments. These details are automatically accounted for by tweaking segment lengths and other captured segment variables just before rendering a path.\n\n\n\n\nAttachments\n\n\nattach!\n is one of the most useful functions defined in this package.\n\n\nWhen you call \nattach!\n, you are defining a coordinate system local to somewhere along the target \nPath\n, saying that a \nCellReference\n should be placed at the origin of that coordinate system (or slightly away from it if you want the cell to be one one side of the path or the other). The local coordinate system will rotate as the path changes orientations. The origin of the \nCellReference\n corresponds how the referenced cell should be displaced with respect to the origin of the local coordinate system. This differs from the usual meaning of the origin of a \nCellReference\n, which is how the referenced cell should be displaced with respect to the origin of a containing \nCell\n.\n\n\nThe same \nCellReference\n can be attached to multiple points along multiple paths. If the cell reference is modified (e.g. rotation, origin, magnification) before rendering, the changes should be reflected at all attachment points. The attachment of the cell reference is not a perfect abstraction: a \nCellReference\n must ultimately live inside a \nCell\n, but an unrendered \nPath\n does not live inside any cell. If the path is modified further before rendering, the attachment points will follow the path modifications, moving the origins of the local coordinate systems. The origin fields of the cell references do not change as the path is modified.\n\n\nAttachments are implemented by introducing a \nPaths.DecoratedStyle\n, which is kind of a meta-\nStyle\n: it remembers where to attach \nCellReferences\n, but how the path itself is actually drawn is deferred to a different \nStyle\n object that it retains a reference to. One can repeat a \nDecoratedStyle\n with one attachment to achieve a periodic placement of \nCellReferences\n (like a \nCellArray\n, but along the path). Or, one long segment with a \nDecoratedStyle\n could have several attachments to achieve a similar effect.\n\n\nWhen a \nPath\n is rendered, it is turned into \nPolygons\n living in some \nCell\n. The attachments remain \nCellReferences\n, now living inside of a \nCell\n and not tied to an abstract path. The notion of local coordinate systems along the path no longer makes sense because the abstract path has been made concrete, and the polygons are living in the coordinate system of the containing cell. Each attachment to the former path now must have its origin referenced to the origin of the containing cell, not to local path coordinate systems. Additionally, the references may need to rotate according to how the path was locally oriented. As a result, even if the same \nCellReference\n was attached multiple times to a path, now we need distinct \nCellReference\n objects for each attachment, as well as for each time a corresponding \nDecoratedStyle\n is rendered.\n\n\nSuppose we want the ability to transform between coordinate systems, especially between the coordinate system of a referenced cell and the coordinate system of a parent cell. At first glance it would seem like we could simply define a transform function, taking the parent cell and the cell reference we are interested in. But how would we actually identify the particular cell reference we want? Looking in the tree of references for an attached \nCellReference\n will not work: distinct \nCellReferences\n needed to be made after the path was rendered, and so the particular \nCellReference\n object initially attached is not actually in the \nCell\n containing the rendered path.\n\n\nTo overcome this problem, we make searching for the appropriate \nCellReference\n easier. Suppose a path with attachments has been rendered to a \nCell\n, which is bound to symbol \naaa\n. A \nCellReference\n referring to a cell named \"bbb\" was attached twice.

Suppose the path is a straight line with angle 0\u00b0.

If \nlocation == 0\n, nothing special happens. If \nlocation == -1\n, then the point of attachment for the reference is on the leftmost edge of the waveguide (the rendered polygons; the path itself has no width). Likewise if \nlocation == 1\n, the point of attachment is on the rightmost edge. This option does not automatically rotate the cell reference, apart from what is already done as described in the first paragraph. You can think of this option as setting a special origin for the coordinate system that rotates with the path. For instance, an origin for the cell reference of \nPoint(0.,10.)\n together with \nlocation == -1\n will put the cell at 10 above the edge of a rendered (finite width) path with angle 0\u00b0.\n\n\nsource\n\n\n#\n\n\nDevices.Paths.corner!\n \n \nFunction\n.\n\n\ncorner!{T\n:Coordinate}(p::Path{T}, \u03b1, sty::DiscreteStyle=discretestyle1(p))\n\n\n\n\n\nAppend a sharp turn or \"corner\" to path \np\n with angle \n\u03b1\n.\n\n\nThe style chosen for this corner, if not specified, is the last \nDiscreteStyle\n used in the path.\n\n\nsource\n\n\n#\n\n\nDevices.Paths.meander!\n \n \nFunction\n.\n\n\nmeander!(p::Path, len, straightlen, r, \u03b1)\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternate between going straight with length \nstraightlen\n and turning with radius \nr\n and angle \n\u03b1\n.

            "text": "attach!  is one of the most useful functions defined in this package.  When you call  attach! , you are defining a coordinate system local to somewhere along the target  Path , saying that a  CellReference  should be placed at the origin of that coordinate system (or slightly away from it if you want the cell to be one one side of the path or the other). The local coordinate system will rotate as the path changes orientations. The origin of the  CellReference  corresponds how the referenced cell should be displaced with respect to the origin of the local coordinate system. This differs from the usual meaning of the origin of a  CellReference , which is how the referenced cell should be displaced with respect to the origin of a containing  Cell .  The same  CellReference  can be attached to multiple points along multiple paths. If the cell reference is modified (e.g. rotation, origin, magnification) before rendering, the changes should be reflected at all attachment points. The attachment of the cell reference is not a perfect abstraction: a  CellReference  must ultimately live inside a  Cell , but an unrendered  Path  does not live inside any cell. If the path is modified further before rendering, the attachment points will follow the path modifications, moving the origins of the local coordinate systems. The origin fields of the cell references do not change as the path is modified.  Attachments are implemented by introducing a  Paths.DecoratedStyle , which is kind of a meta- Style : it remembers where to attach  CellReferences , but how the path itself is actually drawn is deferred to a different  Style  object that it retains a reference to. One can repeat a  DecoratedStyle  with one attachment to achieve a periodic placement of  CellReferences  (like a  CellArray , but along the path). Or, one long segment with a  DecoratedStyle  could have several attachments to achieve a similar effect.  When a  Path  is rendered, it is turned into  Polygons  living in some  Cell . The attachments remain  CellReferences , now living inside of a  Cell  and not tied to an abstract path. The notion of local coordinate systems along the path no longer makes sense because the abstract path has been made concrete, and the polygons are living in the coordinate system of the containing cell. Each attachment to the former path now must have its origin referenced to the origin of the containing cell, not to local path coordinate systems. Additionally, the references may need to rotate according to how the path was locally oriented. As a result, even if the same  CellReference  was attached multiple times to a path, now we need distinct  CellReference  objects for each attachment, as well as for each time a corresponding  DecoratedStyle  is rendered.  Suppose we want the ability to transform between coordinate systems, especially between the coordinate system of a referenced cell and the coordinate system of a parent cell. At first glance it would seem like we could simply define a transform function, taking the parent cell and the cell reference we are interested in. But how would we actually identify the particular cell reference we want? Looking in the tree of references for an attached  CellReference  will not work: distinct  CellReferences  needed to be made after the path was rendered, and so the particular  CellReference  object initially attached is not actually in the  Cell  containing the rendered path.  To overcome this problem, we make searching for the appropriate  CellReference  easier. Suppose a path with attachments has been rendered to a  Cell , which is bound to symbol  aaa . A  CellReference  referring to a cell named \"bbb\" was attached twice. To recall the second attachment:  aaa[\"bbb\",2]  (the index defaults to 1 if unspecified). We can go deeper if we want to refer to references inside that attachment:  aaa[\"bbb\",2][\"ccc\"] . In this manner, it is easy to find the right  CellReference  to use with  Cells.transform(::Cell, ::Cells.CellRef) .",

The second method permits ranges or arrays of  t  and  location  to be specified (if the lengths do not match,  location  is cycled).  By default, the attachment(s) occur at  t \u2208 [zero(pathlength(s)),pathlength(s)]  along the most recent path segment  s , but a different path segment index can be specified using  i . The reference is oriented with zero rotation if the path is pointing at 0\u00b0, otherwise it is rotated with the path.  The origin of the cell reference tells the method where to place the cell  with respect to a coordinate system that rotates with the path . Suppose the path is a straight line with angle 0\u00b0. Then an origin of  Point(0.,10.)  will put the cell at 10 above the path, or 10 to the left of the path if it turns left by 90\u00b0.  The  location  option is for convenience. If  location == 0 , nothing special happens. If  location == -1 , then the point of attachment for the reference is on the leftmost edge of the waveguide (the rendered polygons; the path itself has no width). Likewise if  location == 1 , the point of attachment is on the rightmost edge. This option does not automatically rotate the cell reference, apart from what is already done as described in the first paragraph. You can think of this option as setting a special origin for the coordinate system that rotates with the path. For instance, an origin for the cell reference of  Point(0.,10.)  together with  location == -1  will put the cell at 10 above the edge of a rendered (finite width) path with angle 0\u00b0.  source  #  Devices.Paths.corner!
