Computes a resampled `grid` given anchor points so that `f.(grid)` is sufficiently
smooth. The method used is to create an initial grid around the anchor points and refine
intervals. When an interval becomes "straight enough" it is no longer divided.
Adapted from a contribution to PlotUtils.jl from Kristoffer Carlsson.

- `max_recursions`: how many times each interval is allowed to be refined.
- `max_change`: specifies acceptable change between evaluations of `f` on subsequent grid
  points, as estimated by the derivative times the distance between grid points.
  Typically, `f` is the angle of a path in the plane, so this is often an angle threshold.
  This condition is approximately valid in the end result, but may be weakly violated.
  This condition may be grossly violated if `max_recursions` is too low.
- `rand_factor`: between anchor points, `adapted_grid` will wiggle initial grid points
  a bit to prevent aliasing. The wiggling is sampled uniformly from the interval:
  `[-rand_factor, rand_factor]`, times the distance between three grid points
  (e.g. `i+1` and `i-1`). A random number generator is given a fixed seed every time
  `adapted_grid` is called, so the rendered results are deterministic.
- `grid_step`: Step size for initial grid points. If you set this to be larger than
  the maximum anchor point, then the lowest resolution consistent with `max_change` is used
  (unless `f` has some fast variations that the algorithm might miss).
