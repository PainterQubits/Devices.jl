## Summary

Points live in a Cartesian coordinate system with
`Real` or `Unitful.Length` coordinates:

```jldoctest
julia> Point(1,1)
2-element Devices.Points.Point{Int64}:
 1
 1

julia> Point(1.0,1.0)
2-element Devices.Points.Point{Float64}:
 1.0
 1.0

julia> Point(1.0u"μm", 1.0u"μm")
2-element Devices.Points.Point{Quantity{Float64, Dimensions:{𝐋}, Units:{μm}}}:
 1.0 μm
 1.0 μm
```

If a point has `Real` coordinates, the absence of a unit is interpreted to mean
`μm` whenever the geometry is saved to a GDS format, but until then it is just
considered to be a pure number. Therefore you cannot mix and match `Real` and
`Length` coordinates:

```jldoctest
julia> Point(1.0u"μm", 1.0)
ERROR: Cannot use `Point` with this combination of types.
```

You can add Points together or scale them:
```jldoctest
julia> 3*Point(1,1)+Point(1,2)
2-element Devices.Points.Point{Int64}:
 4
 5
```

You can also do affine transformations by composing any number of `Translation`
and `Rotation`s, which will return a callable object representing the
transformation. You can type the following Unicode symbols with `\degree` and
`\circ` tab-completions in the Julia REPL or using the Atom package
`latex-completions`.

```jldoctest
julia> aff = Rotation(90°) ∘ Translation(Point(1,2))
AffineMap([0.0 -1.0; 1.0 0.0], (-2.0,1.0))

julia> aff(Point(0,0))
2-element Devices.Points.Point{Float64}:
 -2.0
  1.0
```

## Implementation details

Points are implemented using the abstract type `FieldVector`
from [StaticArrays.jl](https://github.com/JuliaArrays/StaticArrays.jl).
This permits a fast, efficient representation of
coordinates in the plane. Additionally, unlike `Tuple` objects, we can
add points together, simplifying many function definitions.

To interface with gdspy, we simply convert the `Point` object to a `Tuple` and
let [PyCall.jl](https://github.com/stevengj/PyCall.jl) figure out what to do.
