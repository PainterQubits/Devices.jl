## Paths

```@docs
Paths.Path
Paths.Path{T<:Real}(::Point{2,T}, ::Real, ::Paths.Style)
Paths.Path{T<:Real}(::Tuple{T,T})
Paths.Path{T<:Real}(::Tuple{T,T}, ::Real)
Paths.pathlength(::Path)
```

## Segments

```@docs
Paths.Segment
Paths.Straight
Paths.Turn
Paths.CompoundSegment
```

## Styles

```@docs
Paths.Style
Paths.Trace
Paths.CPW
Paths.CompoundStyle
Paths.DecoratedStyle
```

## Path interrogation

```@docs
Paths.direction
Paths.pathlength
Paths.p0
Paths.setp0!
Paths.α0
Paths.setα0!
Paths.p1
Paths.α1
Paths.style0
Paths.style1
```

## Path building

```@docs
append!(::Path, ::Path)
adjust!
launch!
meander!
param
simplify!
straight!
turn!
```

## Interfacing with gdspy

The Python package `gdspy` is used for rendering paths into polygons. Ultimately
we intend to remove this dependency.

```@docs
Paths.distance
Paths.extent
Paths.paths
Paths.width
```
