Cells are used to logically group polygons or references to other cells
into a single entity.

```@docs
Cell
Cell(::AbstractString)
Cell{T<:Real}(::AbstractString, ::AbstractArray{Devices.AbstractPolygon{T},1})
Cell{T<:Real}(::AbstractString, ::AbstractArray{Devices.AbstractPolygon{T},1},
    ::AbstractArray{CellReference,1})
bounds(::Cell)
center(::Cell)
```

## Referenced and arrayed cells

Cells can be arrayed or referenced within other cells for efficiency or to reduce
display complexity.

```@docs
CellArray
CellArray{T<:Real}(::Cell, ::Point{2,T}, ::Point{2,T}, ::Point{2,T},
    ::Integer, ::Integer)
CellArray{T<:Real}(::Cell, ::Range{T}, ::Range{T})
CellReference
CellReference{T<:Real}(::Cell, ::Point{2,T})
bounds{S<:Real, T<:Real}(::CellArray{Cell{S},T})
bounds(::CellReference)
```

## Resolving references

When saving cells to disk, there will be a tree of interdependencies and logically
one would prefer to write the leaf nodes of the tree before any dependent cells.
These functions are used to traverse the tree and then find the optimal ordering.

```@docs
traverse!
order!
